README for scripts/
===================


This directory contains a couple of things that might be useful:

  tools.scm

    Helper functions for some of the scripts here.

  test-dist.sh

    Takes a platform-designator and the path to a tarball and unpacks,
    builds and tests the chicken distribution contained therein.

  wiki2html.scm

    A simple svnwiki -> HTML translator used for the manual. Needs
    `htmlprag' and `matchable' eggs installed.

  make-egg-index.scm

    Creates an egg index HTML page from a local working copy of a
    `release/<number>' egg tree.

  makedist.scm

    Creates a distribution tarball from a chicken svn checkout.

  mini-salmonella.scm

    A minimalistic version of `salmonella', the egg-test tool. It
    takes a path to a local checkout of the extensions repository
    and compiles each egg from scratch, reporting success or 
    failure.

  identify-branch

    Obtains the branchname, if this is a git(1) checkout, otherwise
    does nothing.
