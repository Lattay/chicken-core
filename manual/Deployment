== Deployment

CHICKEN generates fully native binaries that can be distributed like 
normal C/C++ programs. There are various methods of deployment,
depending on platform, linkage, external dependencies and wether
the application should be built from sources or precompiled and
whether the CHICKEN runtime-libraries are expected on the destination
system or if the application should be completely self-contained.

=== Simple executables

The simplest form of deployment is the single executable. The runtime
libraries ({{libchicken.so}} or {{libchicken.dll}} is required for these
programs to run, unless you link your application statically:

  % csc myprogram.scm
  % ldd myprogram               # on linux
            linux-gate.so.1 =>  (0xb805c000)
            libchicken.so.5 => /home/felix/chicken/core/lib/libchicken.so.5 (0xb7c22000)
            libm.so.6 => /lib/tls/i686/cmov/libm.so.6 (0xb7bec000)
            libdl.so.2 => /lib/tls/i686/cmov/libdl.so.2 (0xb7be7000)
            libc.so.6 => /lib/tls/i686/cmov/libc.so.6 (0xb7a84000)
            /lib/ld-linux.so.2 (0xb805d000)
