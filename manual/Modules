=== Modules

To allow some control over visible bindings and to organize code at
the global level, a simple module system is available. A ''module''
defines a set of toplevel expressions that are initially evaluated in
an empty syntactical environment. By ''importing'' other modules,
exported value- and macro-bindings are made visible inside the
environment of the module that imports them.

Note that modules are purely syntactical - they do not change the
control flow or delay the execution of the contained toplevel
forms. The body of a module is executed at load-time, when code is
loaded or accessed via the {{uses}} declaration, just like normal
toplevel expressions. Exported macro-definitions are compiled as
well, and can be accessed in interpreted or compiled code by loading
and importing the compiled file that contains the module.

Imported toplevel bindings can be assigned (with {{set!}}), any modifications
to these will change the global value and will be visible to other
modules that export or import the same toplevel binding.

A module is initially empty (has no visible bindings). You must at least
import the {{scheme}} module to do anything useful. To access any
of the non-standard macros and procedures, import the {{chicken}}
module.

CHICKEN's module system has the following features and shortcomings:

* Indirect exports for syntax definitions must be listed
* Separation of compile/expansion-time and run-time code is provided, which allows cross compilation
* Module-generating code is only created, when needed
* Supports batch-compilation of separate compilation units
* No separate "identifier" type is used, all identifiers appearing in code and processed in expansions are symbols
* The module system is fully optional


==== module

<macro>(module NAME (EXPORT ...) BODY ...)</macro><br>
<macro>(module NAME (EXPORT ...) FILENAME)</macro>
<macro>(module NAME * BODY ...)</macro>

Defines a module with the name {{NAME}}, a set of exported bindings
and a contained sequence of toplevel expressions that are evaluated in
an empty syntactical environment. 

{{(EXPORT ...)}} should be an export-specification which holds a list
of identifiers to be exported from the module and which should be
visible when imported into another module or the toplevel
environment. {{EXPORT}} may have any of the following forms:

{{IDENTIFIER}} names a value- or syntax binding to be exported.

{{(IDENTIFIER1 ...)}} or {{(syntax: IDENTIFIER1 ...)}} exports
{{IDENTIFIER1}} (which should name a macro) and also arranges for the
remaining identifiers in the list to be visible in the expansion of
the macro (this is a hint to the module expander to export bindings
referenced by syntax-definitions which make use of them, but which
would normally be internal to the module - which gives more
opportunities for optimization). 

{{(interface: INTERFACENAME)}} adds all exports defined for the given
interface to be added to the list of exported identifiers of this
module.

As a special case, specifying {{*}} instead of an export-list
will export all definitions.

When the {{BODY}} consists of a single string, it is treated
like {{(include FILENAME)}}.

Nested modules, modules not at toplevel (i.e. local modules) or
mutually recursive modules are not supported.

When compiled, the module information, including exported macros
is stored in the generated binary and available when loading
it into interpreted or compiled code. Note that this is different
to normal macros (outside of module declarations), which are normally
not exported from compiled code.

Note that the module system is only a device for controlling the
mapping of identifiers to value or syntax bindings. Modules do not
instantiate separate environments that contain their own bindings, as
do many other module systems. Redefinition or assignment of value or
syntax bindings will modify the original, imported definition.

Syntax expansions may result in module-definitions, but must be
at toplevel.


==== export

<macro>(export EXPORT ...)</macro>

Allows augmenting module-exports from inside the module-body.
{{EXPORT}} is if the same form as an export-specifier in a 
{{module}} export list. An export must precede its first occurrence
(either use or definition).

If used outside of a module, then this form does nothing.

==== import

<macro>(import IMPORT ...)</macro>

Imports module bindings into the current syntactical environment.
The visibility of any imported bindings is limited to the current
module, if used inside a module-definition, or to the current
compilation unit, if compiled and used outside of a module.

Importing a module does not load or link it - this is a separate
operation from importing its bindings.

{{IMPORT}} may be a module name or an ''import specifier'', where a
module name is either a symbol or a list of the form {{(srfi N)}}.
An {{IMPORT}} defines a set of bindings that are to be made visible
in the current scope.

Note that the imported bindings are only visible in the next toplevel
expression (regardless of whether the import appears inside or outside
a module):

  (begin
    (import m1)
    ...)              ; imports not visible here
  
  ...                ; imports visible here

===== only

 [import specifier] (only IMPORT IDENTIFIER ...)

Only import the listed value- or syntax bindings from the set given
by {{IMPORT}}.

===== except

 [import specifier] (except IMPORT IDENTIFIER ...)

Remove the listed identifiers from the import-set defined by {{IMPORT}}.

===== rename

 [import specifier] (rename IMPORT (OLD1 NEW1) ...)

Renames identifiers imported from {{IMPORT}}.

===== prefix

 [import specifier] (prefix IMPORT SYMBOL)

Prefixes all imported identifiers with {{SYMBOL}}.


==== import-for-syntax

<macro>(import-for-syntax IMPORT ...)</macro>

Similar to {{import}}, but imports exported bindings of a module into
the environment in which macro transformers are evaluated. 

Note: currently this isn't fully correct - value bindings are still
imported into the normal environment because a separate import
environment for syntax has not been implemented (syntactic bindings
are kept separate correctly).


==== reexport

<macro>(reexport IMPORT ...)</macro>

Imports {{IMPORT ...}} and automatically exports all imported identifiers.
This can be used to build ''compound modules'': modules that just extend
other modules:

<enscript hightlight=scheme>
(module r4rs ()
  (import scheme chicken)
  (reexport 
    (except scheme 
      dynamic-wind values call-with-values eval scheme-report-environment
      null-environment interaction-environment)))
</enscript>


=== define-interface

<macro>(define-interface INTERFACENAME (EXPORT ...))</macro>

Defines an ''interface'', a group of exports that can be used in
module-definitions using the {{(interface: INTERFACE)}} syntax.
See the definition of {{module}} above for an explanation of
{{EXPORT}} specifications.


=== import libraries

''import libraries'' allow the syntactical (compile-time) 
and run-time parts of a compiled module to be separated into a normal
compiled file and a shared library that only contains macro definitions
and module information. This reduces the size of executables and
simplifies compiling code that uses modules for a different architecture
than the machine the compiler is executing on (i.e. "cross" compilation).

By using the {{emit-import-library}} compiler-option or declaration,
a separate file is generated that only contains syntactical information
(including macros) for a module. {{import}} will automatically find and
load an import library for a currently unknown module, if the import-
library is either in the extension repository or the current include
path. Import libraries may also be explicitly loaded into the
compiler by using the {{-extend}} compiler option. Interpreted code
can simply load the import library to make the module-definition
available. Macro-support definitions defined with {{define-for-syntax}}
and expansion-time expressions of the form {{(begin-for-syntax ...)}}
will be added to import libraries to make them available for exported
macros. Note that these definitions will ruthlessly pollute the 
toplevel namespace and so they should be used sparingly.


=== Predefined modules

Import libraries for the following modules are initially
available:

 [module] scheme

Exports the standard R5RS bindings.

 [module] chicken

Everything from the {{library}}, {{eval}} and {{expand}} library units.

 [module] extras
 [module] data-structures
 [module] ports
 [module] lolevel
 [module] posix
 [module] regex
 [module] srfi-1
 [module] srfi-4
 [module] srfi-13
 [module] srfi-14
 [module] srfi-18
 [module] srfi-69
 [module] tcp
 [module] utils

Modules exporting the bindings from the respective library units.

 [module] foreign

Exports all macros and procedures that are used to access foreign
C/C++ code.


=== Examples of using modules

Here is a silly little test module to demonstrate how modules
are defined and used:

 ;; hello.scm
 
 (module test (hello greet)
   (import scheme)
 
   (define-syntax greet
     (syntax-rules ()
       ((_ whom) 
        (begin
          (display "Hello, ")
          (display whom)
          (display " !\n") ) ) ) )
 
   (define (hello)
     (greet "world") )  )

The module {{test}} exports one value ({{hello}}) and one syntax
binding ({{greet}}). To use it in {{csi}}, the interpreter,
simply load and import it:

  #;1> ,l hello.scm
  ; loading hello.scm ...
  ; loading /usr/local/lib/chicken/4/scheme.import.so ...
  #;1> (import test)
  #;2> (hello)
  Hello, world !
  #;3> (greet "you")
  Hello, you !

The module can easily be compiled

  % csc -s hello.scm

and used in an identical manner:

  #;1> ,l hello.so
  ; loading hello.so ...
  #;1> (import test)
  #;2> (hello)
  Hello, world !
  #;3> (greet "you")
  Hello, you !

If you want to keep macro-definitions in a separate file, use import
libraries:

  % csc -s hello.scm -j test
  % csc -s test.import.scm

  #;1> ,l hello.so
  ; loading hello.so ...
  #;1> (import test)
  ; loading ./test.import.so ...
  #;2> (hello)
  Hello, world !
  #;3> (greet "you")
  Hello, you !

If an import library (compiled or in source-form) is located
somewhere in the extensions-repository or include path, it
is automatically loaded on import. Otherwise you have to
load it manually:

  #;1> ,l hello.so
  ; loading hello.so ...
  #;1> ,l test.import.so
  ; loading test.import.so ...
  #;1> (import test)
  #;2> 

Note that you must us import libraries if you compile code
that depends on other modules. The compiler will not execute
the modules that are refered to by compiled code, and thus
the binding information and exported syntax of the former
must be available separately.


=== Functors

A ''functor'' is a higher-order module that can be parameterized with
other modules. A functor defines the body of a module for a set or
argument modules and can be instantiated with concrete module names
specializing the code contained in the functor. This is best explained
with an example:

<enscript highlight=scheme>
XXX need example here...
</enscript>

The general syntax of a functor definition looks like this:

<enscript highlight=scheme>
(functor (FUNCTORNAME (ARGUMENTMODULE1 EXPORTS1) ...) 
  FUNCTOREXPORTS
  BODY)
</enscript>

This functor definition does not generate any code. This is done
by ''instantiating'' the functor for specific input modules:

<enscript highlight=scheme>
(module MODULENAME = (FUNCTORNAME MODULENAME1 ...))
</enscript>

Inside {{BODY}}, references to {{ARGUMENTMODULE}} will be replaced by
the corresponding {{MODUELNAME}} argument. The instantiation expands
into the complete functor-code {{BODY}} and as such can be considered
a particular sort of macro-expansion. Note that there is no
requirement that a specific export of an argument-module must be
syntax or non-syntax - it can be syntax in one instantiation and a
function definition in another.

A "degenerate" form of module assignment is

<enscript highlight=scheme>
(module MODULENAME1 = MODULENAME2)
</enscript>

which just defines the alias {{MODULENAME1}} for the module {{MODULENAME2}}.

Since functors exist at compile time, they can be stored in
import-libraries via {{-emit-import-library FUNCTORNAME}} or
{{-emit-all-import-libraries}} (see [[Using the compiler]] for more
information about this). That allows you to import functors for later
instantiation.
